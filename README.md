# JS-DSA

Largely based on the Traversy Media - JS Challenges DSA Course.

Skipped majority of the second level basic challenges because they weren't challenging.
I also skipped majority of the higher-order-array challenges, as they were not really challenging me. I always completed the last challenge of each category I thought I was not challenged by.

15/6/2024 - At this point these challenges are exercises for me because I know about algorithmic complexity and data structures.

19/6/2024 - My solutions vary from the ones proposed by the course. However, they do take into account runtime complexity so all solutions should be achieving linear runtime.
