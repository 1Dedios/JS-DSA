# JS-DSA

Largely based on the Traversy Media - JS Challenges DSA Course.

Skipped majority of the second level basic challenges because they weren't challenging.
I also skipped majority of the higher-order-array challanges, as they were not really challenging me. I always completed the last challenge of each category I thought I was not challenged by.
